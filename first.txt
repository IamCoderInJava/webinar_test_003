1. this is my INITIAL input into first.txt file.
2. I am making changes to this first.txt file after it was initailly committed.


After I can either do below:

(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
(use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

or with git checkout command discard changes.
